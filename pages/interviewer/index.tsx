            Each panelist is required to award points to the candidate being
            interviewed based on the following rubric:
          </p>
          <p className="my-5 text-lg font-bold italic">
            Technical questions (30 points)
          </p>
          <p className="my-5 text-lg text-blue-850">
            Candidate&apos;s knowledge about their field of study. Specifically,
            please try to assess fundamental concepts of their subject which
            would be critical for them in their higher studies.
          </p>
          <p className="my-5 text-lg font-bold italic">
            Language and clarity of thought (20 points)
          </p>
          <p className="my-5 text-lg text-blue-850">
            Basic English language proficiency/fluency. Specifically, please try
            to assess if they are equipped to prepare their application package
            and appear for an interview with their prospective supervisor
            without major flaws in language. However, it does not mean that any
            special literary/oratory skills have to be rewarded.

          <p className="my-5 text-lg font-bold italic">
            Motivation for higher studies (40 points)

          <p className="my-5 text-lg text-blue-850">
            Candidate&apos;s motivation for higher studies abroad. We encourage
            you to probe the students in detail about their plans. Specifically,
            please try to figure out where higher education abroad stands in
            their priority list as opposed to taking up alternate career options
            upon completion of their current degree. Motivation also gauges
            their genuine love for the subject instead of a wish to travel
            abroad or getting this scholarship just for improving their CVs.
            Please do your best to assess if they will be able to persevere in
            the arduous process of the applications, and later the grad school.

            This is a bit of an open-ended section to reward any unique quality
            that you may observe in the candidate. As the name of this category
            implies, please gauge the personality of the candidate on an
            all-round basis.

          <h2 className="mt-10 mb-5 text-2xl font-bold">Recording Points</h2>
          <p className="my-5 text-lg text-blue-850">
            After interviewing each candidate, each panelist is expected to
            record the points based on their own impartial and rational judgment
            of the candidate&apos;s aforementioned abilities. To this end, use
            our web-portal where you can easily enter and record the points.
            This has been already discussed in item-2: Candidate Background. We
            recommend you to record the points on an excel sheet or a piece of
            paper, as a backup.
