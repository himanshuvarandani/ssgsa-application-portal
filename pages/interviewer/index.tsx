            We encourage you to probe the students in detail about their plans.
            Specifically, please try to figure out where higher education abroad
            stands in their priority list as opposed to taking up alternate
            career options upon completion of their current degree. Motivation
            also gauges their genuine love for the subject instead of a wish to
            travel abroad or getting this scholarship just for improving their
            CVs. Please do your best to assess if they will be able to persevere
            in the arduous process of the applications, and later the grad
            school.

            A candidate must have basic English language proficiency/fluency.
            Specifically, please try to assess if they are equipped to prepare
            their application package and appear for an interview with their
            prospective supervisor without major flaws in language. However, it
            does not mean that any special literary/oratory skills have to be
            rewarded.

            record the points based on their own impartial and rational judgment
            of the candidate&apos;s aforementioned abilities. To this end, use
            our web-portal where you can easily enter and record the points. We
            recommend you to record the points on an excel sheet or a piece of
            paper, as a backup.
